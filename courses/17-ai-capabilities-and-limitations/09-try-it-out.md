# AI Capabilities and Limitations

SECTION 1: Introduction

    A natural instinct when using AI is to give it everything. Paste in the whole document. Include every message. Add all the context you can find. More information means better answers, right?

    Not always. There's a phenomenon that anyone who has crammed for an exam knows intuitively: there's a limit to how much you can hold in mind at once. And the things in the middle tend to disappear first.

    Before we talk about how this affects AI models, let's see how it affects you.





   SECTION 2: The Memory Test

    ## The Memory Test




         Phase 1: Briefing


            Memory Test
            You'll see 15 words, one at a time. Each appears for about 1.5 seconds. Try to remember as many as you can.

         Phase 2: Word display


         Phase 3: Recall


         Phase 4: Results








   SECTION 3: The Science

    ## The U-Shaped Curve

    What you just experienced has a name: the serial position effect. Psychologists have studied it for over a century. Items at the beginning of a list benefit from primacy (they get rehearsed more), and items at the end benefit from recency (they're still fresh). The middle gets neither advantage.

    The fascinating part: large language models exhibit the same pattern. In 2023, researchers at Stanford tested what happens when you place a key fact at different positions within a long context window. Accuracy was highest when the fact appeared at the very beginning or very end — and dropped by more than 30% when it was buried in the middle.

    This isn't a quirk. It's structural. Transformer attention patterns naturally weight the edges of the context window more heavily.





   SECTION 4: What This Means for You

    ## What This Means for Prompting

    If you paste a 20-page document into a prompt and ask a question about something on page 11, the model is more likely to miss it than something on page 1 or page 20. This has real implications for how you structure context.



        ❌ Dangerous pattern

          System prompt
          Chat message 1
          Chat message 2
          ...
          ⚠ Key instruction buried here
          ...
          Chat message 18
          Latest user message



        ✓ Safer pattern

          System prompt
          ★ Key instruction (up front)
          Chat message 1
          Chat message 2
          ...
          Chat message 18
          Latest user message
          ★ Key instruction (repeated)




    The practical advice is straightforward: put your most important instructions at the beginning and end of the context. If a constraint absolutely must be followed, state it early in the system prompt and restate it near the end. Don't rely on the model to give equal weight to everything in between.

    This is the starting point, not the ceiling. As you get more fluent you'll discover increasingly sophisticated ways to structure context so the model reliably understands what matters — leveraging where in the window information sits, what to include versus cut, and how to keep critical instructions from sliding into the dead zone. The goal is always the same: make it obvious to Claude what you actually need.





   SECTION 5: Takeaway

    ## The Bigger Picture

    Context degradation is the reason that "just give it more context" is not always the answer. Every piece of context you add pushes other pieces further into the middle — the attention dead zone. This is the core tension of context engineering: not just what to include, but where to put it and what to leave out.


      Key takeaway
      More context ≠ better results. The model's attention is finite. Curate ruthlessly, place strategically, and repeat what matters.


    Your own memory test told you this already. The words in the middle vanished. The same thing happens inside every long conversation, every pasted document, every context window that's been filled to the brim. The fix isn't more — it's smarter.
