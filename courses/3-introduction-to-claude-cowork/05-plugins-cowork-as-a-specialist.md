### What a plugin is

Overview![Plugins: turn Cowork into a specialist for your role](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F6oz04skclb1pbkcboeiosbn5o%2Fpublic%2F1773939289%2Fslide-10-plugins.1773939289619.png)

Plugins give Cowork domain expertise. Each one comes with built-in knowledge and workflows for a specific function, so Claude approaches your task the way a specialist would.

A plugin is a bundle—several pieces packaged together for a role or domain:

- Skills — Instructions for handling specific workflows. Claude draws on them automatically, or you invoke them with / in the prompt. Example: how to structure a deal brief, /prep-call, /weekly-report.
- Connectors — Reach the systems where the work happens. Example: your CRM, your docs, your messaging.
- Subagents — Parallelize specialized work. Example: one agent per account in a book-wide review.

Open-source plugins are available for most knowledge-work roles: sales, marketing, product, finance, legal, operations, customer support, data, and more. They work as-is and can be modified.

### Installing a plugin

Overview![Installing plugins: browse, install, customize](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F6oz04skclb1pbkcboeiosbn5o%2Fpublic%2F1774046474%2Fslide-11-installing-plugins.1774046473979.png)

- Browse. Plugins live in Cowork's Customize area. Find one that matches what you do.
- Install. One click. The plugin is active immediately.
- Customize. Once installed, the plugin is a folder on your machine. Everything in it is readable and editable.

### What's inside

A plugin is just a folder. The structure looks something like this:

> sales-plugin/
> ├── plugin.json         ← manifest: name, description, dependencies
> ├── skills/
> │   ├── deal-brief/     ← how to structure a deal brief
> │   ├── territory/      ← how to build a territory report
> │   └── prep-call/      ← /prep-call in the slash menu
> └── agents/
>     └── account-sweep.md ← subagent for per-account work

Every file is plain text. To change how a skill works, open its file and edit it. To add a new skill, add a folder under skills. There's no build step—Cowork reads the folder directly.

### About skills

You'll notice skills show up a lot—they're the core building block inside plugins. A skill is a markdown file that teaches Claude how to handle one thing: a workflow, a format, a process.

Skills aren't specific to Cowork. They work across Claude's surfaces—in chat, in Claude Code, anywhere Claude runs. A plugin is the Cowork-specific way of bundling skills with the connectors they need to do a job.

If you want to go deeper on skills specifically:

- Skills video course on YouTube — six-part walkthrough
- What are Skills — Help Center reference
- Teach Claude your way of working — tutorial on encoding your own processes
- Introduction to Agent Skills — full course

### Put it into practice

- Open Cowork's Customize area and browse plugins.
- Install the plugin closest to your role.
- Find the installed plugin folder and open one of the skill files. See that it's readable text, written the way you'd brief a teammate.

### What's next
