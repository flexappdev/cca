[![Watch on YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/wyFS10ZiuKI/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyFS10ZiuKI)

A complete study system for the **Claude Certified Architect (CCA)** certification by Anthropic. Three components:

| Component | What it is |
|---|---|
| `/cac` skill | Claude Code agent that coaches you through exam prep |
| `app/` | Next.js study dashboard with practice questions and progress tracking |
| `docs/cac-guide.md` | **[Full certification guide](./docs/cac-guide.md)** — all 5 domains, code examples, anti-patterns, glossary |
| [`cheat/CHEAT.md`](./cheat/CHEAT.md) | Condensed cheat sheet — all 5 domains, quick-reference tables, top anti-patterns |

## The Certification

The **Claude Certified Architect** is Anthropic's official practitioner certification. It validates real-world ability to design, build, and deploy production AI systems using Claude — not just API knowledge.

- **Register:** [anthropic.skilljar.com](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/claude-certified-architect-foundations-access-request)
- **This repo:** [github.com/flexappdev/cac](https://github.com/flexappdev/cac)
- **Official cookbook:** [github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook)

## The 5 Exam Domains

### 1. Prompt Engineering & AI Fluency
Writing accurate, well-structured prompts. Understanding Claude's reasoning, formatting behaviour, and instruction following. Covers system prompts, few-shot examples, chain-of-thought, and output shaping.

### 2. Claude Code Development
- Context management (CLAUDE.md, memory system)
- Hooks — deterministic scripts that run outside the agent loop
- MCP servers — connecting Claude to external services
- GitHub integration
- Anthropic SDK usage (Python / TypeScript)

### 3. Agentic Architecture
Multi-agent system design. Subagents running isolated context loops. Tool integration. Workflow orchestration. Knowing when to use a subagent vs. a tool call vs. a direct response.

Key patterns from the cookbook:
- `patterns/agents/` — orchestrator/worker patterns
- `managed_agents/` — Claude Agent SDK usage
- `claude_agent_sdk/` — building custom agents

### 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Building and consuming MCP servers. Understanding the MCP client/server architecture. Connecting Claude to databases, APIs, file systems, and external services via standardised tool definitions.

### 5. Projects, Artifacts & Skills
Persistent project organisation. Custom skill automation via Claude Code's skill system. Managing artifacts across conversations. Context hygiene.

## Study Plan (12 Weeks)

| Weeks | Focus |
|---|---|
| 1–2 | Prompt engineering fundamentals + Claude's unique behaviours |
| 3–4 | Claude Code: CLAUDE.md, hooks, memory, SDK basics |
| 5–6 | Agentic architecture: subagents, tool use, orchestration |
| 7–8 | MCP: build a server, consume one, understand the protocol |
| 9–10 | Skills, projects, artifacts, context management |
| 11 | Practice questions + anti-pattern review |
| 12 | Final review + exam |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Over-prompting — stuffing every constraint into one giant system prompt instead of layering context
- Using subagents when a tool call is sufficient (unnecessary overhead)
- Skipping CLAUDE.md — losing persistent context between sessions
- Building MCP servers without error handling for tool failures
- Hardcoding model IDs — use `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` variables

## /cac Skill

The `/cac` Claude Code skill acts as an exam coach. Install it once, then invoke from any Claude Code session.

**Install:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/cac
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/cac/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexappdev/cac/main/.claude/skills/cac/SKILL.md
```

Or manually: copy `.claude/skills/cac/SKILL.md` → `~/.claude/skills/cac/SKILL.md`

**Usage:**
```
/cac               # Status + what to study next
/cac quiz          # Random practice question
/cac domain 3      # Deep dive into domain 3 (Agentic Architecture)
/cac cheat         # Compact cheat sheet — all 5 domains
/cac app           # Launch study dashboard at localhost:24301
/cac plan          # Personalised 12-week study plan
/cac resources     # Curated links
```
